# The Fold

People in the church have used paper programs for a long time which leads to wasted paper and wasted money. If they had a way to create and view their ward program on their phone, it would greatly reduce the waste and it would streamline the process of making the weekly sacrament programs.

### The Proposal
Create an app and backend to support creating and viewing ward programs.  
I have already built a version of this and it's on the app store, but for this project we would be recreating or improving the current backend for the first half of the project and then switching everything to firestore for the second half.

### Details
- Team Size: Me and one to two other people
- NoSQL DB Type: Document Based (FireStore specifically)
- Business: This will be a free service with small, non-consequential in app purchases.
- Legal: The business is a Utah LLC.
- Technical: There are a few options  
  I already have a database set up. For this project, the database structure and security could be improved, or we could focus on adding a new feature to the app. Once that is done, everything will have to be moved over to firebase and set up to use a NoSQL document database.
